This is totally not an autobiography, but a fictional tale about a super cool dude named Tom.  Tom was a lad with such a big brain, he couldn't fit through normal doorways.  Luckly Tom was stupid rich, so he expanded all the doorways in his mansion.

Eventually as Tom kept expanding his doorways further, he started to run out of wall space on which to hang all his pictures of his cats. Luckily Tom had such a big brain that he was able to think of a solution to this problem. I would totally be able to think of one myself, but I will defer that to one of the next paragraphs.
